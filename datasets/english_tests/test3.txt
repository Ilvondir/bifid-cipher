All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but
to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen
down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it
blew. I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in
his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or
received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these,
for the most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever
seen open.
